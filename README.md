# Portfolio

Personal portfolio built with **Next.js (React)** and **Tailwind CSS**, meant to be hosted on **Vercel**.

This project is set up so you can learn by building the important pieces yourself, while scaffolding and repetitive layout are already in place.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

```bash
npm run build   # production build check
npm run lint    # eslint
```

## YOUR TURN checklist

Do these yourself — they are the parts you can honestly say you built.

### 1. Personalize your content

Edit [`content/site.ts`](content/site.ts):

- [ ] `name`, `tagline`, `bio`, `location`
- [ ] `links.github`, `links.linkedin`, `links.email`
- [ ] Drop your PDF at [`public/resume.pdf`](public/resume.pdf) (see “Resume PDF” below)
- [ ] `hobbies` copy
- [ ] `projects` — keep placeholders until you have real hobby projects

**Done looks like:** the hero, hobbies, and links show *your* info, not “Your Name”.

### 2. Build the About section

Edit [`components/About.tsx`](components/About.tsx):

- [ ] Replace the dashed “YOUR TURN” placeholder with a real About layout
- [ ] Use `site.bio` (and anything else you want from `site`)
- [ ] Match the site spacing / typography used in nearby sections

**Done looks like:** visitors can read who you are; the green TODO box is gone.

### 3. Build the project card

Edit [`components/ProjectCard.tsx`](components/ProjectCard.tsx):

- [ ] Render `project.title`, `project.blurb`, `project.tags`, and `project.href`
- [ ] Make the card a clear clickable project link
- [ ] Keep styling simple and consistent with the rest of the page

The list wrapper in [`components/Projects.tsx`](components/Projects.tsx) is already wired — you only need the card.

**Done looks like:** the Projects grid shows real cards, not TODO stubs.

### 4. Deploy on Vercel (you own this step)

1. Push this branch / merge to GitHub (`alteoziel/portfolio`).
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → **Add New Project** → import this repo.
3. Leave the defaults (Next.js is detected automatically) → **Deploy**.
4. Open the live URL and confirm the site loads.

**Done looks like:** you have a public URL you can put on your resume / LinkedIn.

## What the agent already built

- Next.js App Router + Tailwind setup
- Shared layout, fonts (Syne + IBM Plex Sans), CSS variables, atmosphere background
- Header, Hero, Projects list wrapper, Hobbies, Links, Contact, Footer
- Content model in `content/site.ts` with placeholders
- Guided starters for `About.tsx` and `ProjectCard.tsx` (not finished implementations)

## Project map

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `content/site.ts` | **Your** content hub |
| `components/About.tsx` | **Your** hand-built section |
| `components/ProjectCard.tsx` | **Your** hand-built card |
| `components/Projects.tsx` | List that maps `site.projects` → `ProjectCard` |
| `app/page.tsx` | Assembles all sections |
| `app/globals.css` | Design tokens + light motion |

## Resume PDF

The site shows your resume as clean page canvases on [`/resume`](app/resume/page.tsx) (no browser PDF toolbar).

1. Export / save your resume as a PDF.
2. Replace the placeholder file: put it at **`public/resume.pdf`** (same name).
3. Leave `site.links.resume` as `"/resume.pdf"` unless you rename the file.
4. Open `/resume` — pages render like paper; use **Download PDF** for the raw file.

How it works:

| Piece | Role |
|---|---|
| `public/resume.pdf` | Your uploaded file (static asset) |
| `components/ResumeViewer.tsx` | Renders PDF pages with `react-pdf` / pdf.js |
| `app/resume/page.tsx` | Route visitors open |
| Header / Links → `/resume` | Entry points from the home page |

## Adding a real project later

1. Add an object to `site.projects` in `content/site.ts`.
2. Optionally drop a screenshot in `public/projects/` and set `image`.
3. Push — Vercel redeploys.

## Stack

- React + Next.js
- Tailwind CSS v4
- TypeScript
